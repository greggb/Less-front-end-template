# Front End Template with LESS

## Overview
This template is my starting point for all new projects. It pulls liberally from [H5BP](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate), [LESS Preboot](https://github.com/markdotto/Preboot.less), [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap), and other assorted LESS resources I've come across.

### Notes

- Includes the log code from H5BP so you can use log instead of console.log (and avoid browser errors)
- Only mixins used in your styles will be included in the compiled style.css file.
- Add and delete as needed. This is only a jumping off point.
